The parent writes "Inicio" to the pipe, child (cat) reads it and prints it onto the screen.

Q68.

The programs dont finish. Child is in a blocking read() call, and the parent is in a blocking waitpid() call.

Q69.

We should use a different pipe, because a pipe is not full duplex. This means that if the escritor wanted to read, it could end up reading what it itself wrote before.

If we use the same pipe, we have to have proper sync between the programs.
