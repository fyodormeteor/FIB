# mkfifo NAMEDPIPE
First shell:  # cat > NAMEDPIPE
Second shell: # cat < NAMEDPIPE

It is not possible because anonymous pipes are strictly local to a process and its child processes.
Its only possible with one terminal.

r = fork();
if (r==0) {
    close(1);  
    dup(4);
    close(4);
}

A socket is similar to a pipe, but allows full-duplex communication and also allows communication through the network
