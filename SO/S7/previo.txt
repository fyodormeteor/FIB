After pressing Ctrl+D, read syscall will return 0, meaning EOF was reached.

# ./es1 < test.txt

# ls -l | grep es returns all the files from the CWD that contain 'es' in their name.
This is done by redirecting the output of ls -l (all the files in the CWD) to grep es, which filters.

# ps -fe | grep bash

In the first case, 4 bytes are written. (size of an int)
In the second case, 5 bytes are written. (size of the string that holds the number)

In myDriver1.c:
struct file_operations fops_driver_1 = {
owner:THIS_MODULE,
read:read_driver_1,
};

In myDriver2.c
    struct file_operations fops_driver_2 = {
    owner:THIS_MODULE,
    read:read_driver_2,
    };

From the source code we see that the function assigned to read is 'read_driver_1' and 'read_driver_2' respectively.

Major and minors are the device driver identifiers. They are used to associate a logical device with its specific access code
